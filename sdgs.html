            For instance, there are <strong>60%</strong> people in food hunger from conflict. In conflict, They aren't be able to provide the food to people living in there.<br>
            they had lived in there can't live that area if conflict finished so that they become refugees

        <dd>Some developing contry, it is difficult to stock the food sanitaly so that it has decaied and becomes that can't eat.
            <br>Also, as water, the half of it is thrown before the<b> Best-before</b> so I think it is very loss. 
        And,that's one-third of all food produced for human consumption (1.3 billion tons of it). 
        <br>Finally, the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) says that if we stopped wasting all that food, we’d save enough to feed 2 billion people .

    As you understand, there are almost Africa and Asia. Also, for expanple, South Sudan has been conflict so that they can't get the food from other country.
    In these area, they aren't able to get a water so they sometimes lose the plants growing if they grow the plants like vegetable
    And, as they rely on inport to get foodstuffed because of climate, the price of things from other country become very high. <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

    <strong>garbege</strong> using native people living that area. Why has he thrown it is that if in garbage, there are species it may bloom.
    so that it can be eaten by human or livestock.Also in this area, the soil was terrible so he has done plowing used <strong>white ant</strong>.
